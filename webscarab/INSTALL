This is the WebScarab OpenSource project, hosted at
http://www.owasp.org/webscarab.
All source code and development stuff is done under
http://sourceforge.net/projects/owasp

Prior to building WebScarab, you should download the various
libraries that it depends on. You can see the list in the ant build.xml
file, in this directory. If you got this file by checking out the source
from the WebScarab CVS repository, you should have the required libraries
already.

WebScarab uses the Apache Ant build tool. In order to build WebScarab, you
should use a reasonably recent version of Ant.

There are two Ant build tasks that depend on external tools, IzPack and 
ProGuard. You are only likely to need these tools if you plan to build
redistributable images of WebScarab. i.e. an installer, or the self-contained
jar. There should be no problem running the common build tasks if you do not 
have these external tools.
